# Reddit Notifier

The purpose of this project is to create a personalized daily email newsletter at 8 am containing top 3 most voted posts (within the last 24 hours) from our (the userâ€™s) favorite sub-reddit channels.
This app interfaces strictly through api.

The Endpoints are:

```
POST /signup - Sign Up to add user
GET /users - Return list of all users
GET /users?id=<id> - Get user by id
GET /users?username=<username> - Get user by username
PUT /users/<id>/subreddit - User can subscribe to subreddit
DELETE /users/<id>/subreddit - User can unsubscribe from subreddit
PUT /users/<id>/notifications - User can turn on or off email notifications
```

I have chosen to use many PUTs,GETs,and DELETEs because who doesn't love idempotency.
POST here are mainly used just for creation.
